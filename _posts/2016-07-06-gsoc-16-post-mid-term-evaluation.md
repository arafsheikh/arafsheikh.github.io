Mid-term evaluations are over and I passed. Yay! 

Coming to my project, most of the stuff is implemented and the plug-in is almost ready for a beta release.
I'm fixing the last few bugs and that should be done in the next few weeks.

The coala Eclipse plug-in will be released with `coala 0.8`.

Here is a video demo of the plug-in in action:
