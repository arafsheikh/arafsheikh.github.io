title: "[GSoC16] Week 12 update"

It is the final week of GSoC and my project is almost complete.
I'm still working on the `coafile` editor, but I haven't been able to devote much time to it since my summer vacations got over.

Nevertheless I've made some progress.
Instead of implementing the GUI of the editor in one go, I'll first implement support for `coafile`.
This will mostly include some syntax highlighting and content assist.
The next step then would be to use this text editor inside a graphical editor.

This would definitely require more than one week to implement, so I'll work on the project after the official deadline too.
And ofcourse the idea is to keep working on the plug-in, and maintaining it.

This is probably my last update on GSoC.
It's been really awesome and I'm thinking of writing another post about my overall experience with GSoC.
