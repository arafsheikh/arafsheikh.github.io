title: "[GSoC16] Week 8 update"

Time flies and it's been an astonishingly quick 8 weeks. I've finished work for the first coala Eclipse release,
and the plug-in will be released with coala 0.8 in the next few days.

Most of the coala team is at EuroPython so the development speed has slowed down.
Nevertheless there are software development sprints this weekend and coala will be participating too.

We also plan on having a mini-conference of our own, and will have lightning talks from GSoC students
and other coala community members.

As I'm nearing the end of my GSoC project, I've started reading up some material in order to get started
with implementing the `coafile` editor. Currently I'm planing to extend either the `AbstractTextEditor` class 
or the `EditorPart` class, or something similar maybe.

Cheers.
