Another week has passed by in this journey and so far it is going great. This week I've been busy adding important functionality to the
[Eclipse plug-in](http://sheikharaf.me/gsoc16/gsoc-16-with-coala.html).

The most important feature in the works is the ability to select bear to use for code analysis. I also had to make some design decisions and one thing I've learned is designing is more
difficult than programming (ofcourse, take this with grain of salt).

Mid-term evaluations are coming and I expect to have a usable plug-in by then.

The major task now is to introduce some basic user-interface elements that make using the plug-in intuitive and easy.
I have begun planning out the GUI with help from my mentor and will be adding some
parts of it in the coming week.

The plug-in currently uses the common `Problems View` for the marker elements. This will change and the plug-in will now have a separate view for `coala` issues. Another
new element will be the `Annotations` that will help better visualize the analysis results.

Cheers!
