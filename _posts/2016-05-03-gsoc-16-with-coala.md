So, my proposal for Google Summer of Code 2016 got accepted. Yay! And now that my exams are over, I finally
have some time to blog about it. So here we go.

Earlier this year I decided to dip my toe in the water of contributing to open source projects. I came across
[`coala`](http://coala-analyzer.org), a language independent static code analysis framework. I started off by fixing
some of the simple `newcomer` issues. This helped me understand the code base of the project. The best part was that 
the `coala` community was extremely friendly and always helpful.

I came with no long-term plans, but I had a really fun time learning new stuff, so I had to stay.
Later Google Summer of Code was announced and `coala` was participating under Python Software Foundation.
I submitted a proposal and it got accepted.

So this summer I will be building a plugin to integrate the awesome `coala` code analysis framework with the
Eclipse IDE. I have a coarse idea of the project and I look forward to discuss it with my mentor *Harsh Dattani* in the
next few weeks of the community bonding period.
