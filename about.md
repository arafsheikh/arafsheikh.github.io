## Me

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering sophomore at Shiv Nadar University, India. I'm a passionate problem solver who has a keen interest in building stuff.

Most of the code I write lives on [Github](https://www.github.com/arafsheikh).

If you want to get in touch, e-mail me at `arafsheikh[at]gmail[dot]com` or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arafsheikh).
