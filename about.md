## Me

Hello! 

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at [Shiv Nadar University](http://www.snu.edu.in/). I have previously interned at [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com). I've also done a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). 

I'm a passionate problem solver with a keen interest in building stuff. Most of the code I write lives on [Github](https://www.github.com/arafsheikh).

If you want to get in touch, e-mail me at `arafsheikh[at]gmail[dot]com` or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheikharaf/).
